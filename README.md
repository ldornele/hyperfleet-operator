# HyperFleet Operator

The HyperFleet Operator packages and operates HyperFleet through OLM. Its
partner-facing API is a single cluster-scoped `HyperFleetConfig` custom
resource; the workloads and supporting objects produced from that resource are
operator-owned implementation details.

## Getting Started

- **Contributing or developing locally:** follow the
  [developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md) for prerequisites, local validation,
  and end-to-end testing.
- **Installing through OLM:** follow the
  [OLM bundle, catalog, and development installation guide](docs/olm.md).
- **Installing on a disconnected OpenShift cluster:** follow the
  [disconnected installation guide](docs/disconnected-install.md).

## Documentation

### Developing and extending the operator

- [Developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md): repository layout, local workflow,
  unit and end-to-end tests, generated files, and troubleshooting.
- [`HyperFleetConfig` reference](docs/hyperfleetconfig-reference.md): complete
  specification, referenced Secret contracts, status conditions, and known
  implementation limits.
- [Component pattern](docs/component-pattern.md): the contract and checklist for
  adding a shared or bundle-specific component.

### Installing and operating the operator

- [OLM bundle, catalog, and development installation](docs/olm.md)
- [Disconnected OpenShift installation](docs/disconnected-install.md)
- [Metrics reference](docs/metrics.md)

The disconnected workflow mirrors the published catalog. The catalog selects
the OLM bundle and its related images.

## Observability

The manager exposes these endpoints by default:

- Liveness: `http://localhost:8080/healthz`
- Readiness: `http://localhost:8080/readyz`
- Metrics: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`

Metrics use the `hyperfleet_operator_*` namespace. See the
[metrics reference](docs/metrics.md) for the complete catalogue, labels, and
example PromQL queries.
